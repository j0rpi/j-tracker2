# j-tracker2
This is a more modern version of j-tracker. It works just like the first version of j-tracker
but has a sleek look and will also support add-ons. File structure has changed alot and code
optimizations and structure is also alot better. 

Note: j-tracker2 in it's current state is completely un-usable. At the moment all that has been
done is a better folder structure, no code changes has been made. Development of j-tracker2 will
begin once i'm satisfied with j-tracker1.
